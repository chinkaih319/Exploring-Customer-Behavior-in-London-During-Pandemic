# How has Airbnb in London been affected by Covid-19?
The project is collaborated with Chin-Kai Huang, Yi-Ching Lin, Liang-Chi Liu, Sih-Yu Huang, and Hsuan-Ting Wu.

We built an interactive dashboard using Dash in Python, designing 10+ charts from supply, demand, pricing and reviews side to analyze key metrics and discovered fluctuations on different aspects during pandemic, providing solutions to truly understand customer satisfaction levels.

For the reviews, we conducted NTLKin Python to perform sentiment analysis on over 500K reviews and designed word cloud to extract keywords.
